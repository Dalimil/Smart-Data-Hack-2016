# Smart-Data-Hack-2016 (Edinburgh, 15-19th Feb 2016)

**5-day hackathon during Innovative Learning Week (ILW) at the University of Edinburgh**

We built a visualization tool for the history of contributions/edits/additions/changes in OpenStreetMaps. Our project uses latest OSM data (obtained dynamically via an API) to display history of contributions to the map in a given area.  
Everything is rendered on top of current OpenStreetMap tiles. We allow the user to click through and view changes done in a given time period and we also provide a 'play button' to show an animation.

In addition to that, we extended our map by creating a layer with available water points in Africa (we had to pre-download this data due to its size). This allows anybody to easily find clause water sources.

**Technologies used:** OpenStreetMaps, Leaflet, Mapbox + OSM API, OSM XML, OSM PBF + jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, Material design, Python,...
